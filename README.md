## About ReTell
ReTell is a app that allows parents to generate custom stories where their child is the main character. ReTell allows the user to tailor the story to their child's interests, and generative AI does the rest âœ¨
Learning moments are also included; parents can choose to include reading, math or history lessons in the story, tailored to the child's grade level.
